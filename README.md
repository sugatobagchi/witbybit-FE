## 1. Install all the dependencies

```bash
    yarn 
```

## 2. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables

```bash
    BACKEND_URL="<THE_URL_OF_THE_BACKEND_SERVER>"
```
If you're running the backend locally, then write the following:

```bash
    BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]"
```
The port number is the port number on which the backend server is running locally.


## Run the project

```bash
    yarn start
```
